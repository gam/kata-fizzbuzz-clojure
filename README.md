Kata repository for FizzBuzz in Clojure
=======================================

This is a repository that can be used as a starting point for doing a Clojure version of the FizzBuzz kata. 
It is based on the description of the FizzBuzz kata on the Coding Dojo WIKI: http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataFizzBuzz

The problem definition is as follows:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print "fizz" and for multiples of five print "buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print 'fizzbuzz'.

A further requirement for the kata: 
The FizzBuzz generator should be programmable; introducing new substitutions should be as simple as introducing a new rule.

As an example, expand the FizzBuzz generator with the following behaviour:
Numbers divisible by two are replaced by 'coconut' and numbers divisible by seven are replaced by 'banana'.

There are several branches:

* *master*
    * Initial kata setup, with only a clojure project with test and implementation files in place
* *1st_attempt* through *7th_attempt*
    * Attempts at solving the kata efficiently, experimenting with different solution variations and intermediary steps.
