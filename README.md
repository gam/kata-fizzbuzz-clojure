Kata repository for FizzBuzz in Clojure
=======================================

This is a repository that can be used as a starting point for doing a Clojure version of the FizzBuzz kata. 
It is based on the description of the FizzBuzz kata on the Coding Dojo WIKI: http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataFizzBuzz

There are several branches:

master: This is the initial kata setup, with only a clojure project with test and implementation files in place
1st_attempt: My first attempt at solving the kata
